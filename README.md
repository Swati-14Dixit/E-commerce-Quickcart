ðŸ›’ MERN E-Commerce Platform

This is a full-stack, production-ready e-commerce application built using the MERN stack â€” MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The platform is designed to offer a seamless and responsive online shopping experience, featuring essential e-commerce functionalities such as product browsing, user authentication, shopping cart, secure checkout, and order management.

Built with scalability and maintainability in mind, this project can serve as both a learning tool for developers and a foundation for real-world commercial applications. The backend handles secure API endpoints, user roles, and payment processing, while the frontend provides a modern and intuitive user interface.
